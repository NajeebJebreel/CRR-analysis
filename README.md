## Content
The repository hosts the necessary code to replicate the analysis outcomes presented in the research paper. To conduct our experiments, we utilized the codebase available at [Confidence-Ranked Reconstruction of Census Microdata from Published Statistics](https://github.com/terranceliu/rap-rank-reconstruction).

To get started, clone the code from the mentioned repository and transfer the `analysis` folder within this repository to the main directory of the cloned repository. Next, follow the instructions found at to generate the reconstructed data.

Once the data reconstruction is complete, navigate to the `analysis` folder, which contains Jupyter notebooks in .IPYNB format. These notebooks can be utilized to conduct the analysis and reproduce the outcomes detailed in our paper.
